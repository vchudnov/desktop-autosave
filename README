Description:

This emacs package will cause the emacs desktop session to be saved
to file periodically (when emacs autosaves) as well as whenever
significant events occur such as opening or saving a file.

Usage:
 Starting desktop-autosave:
   M-x desktop-autosave-start RET <desktop name>
 Showing the session currently being saved:
   M-x desktop-autosave-current-session RET
 Stopping desktop-autosave:
   M-x desktop-autosave-stop
 Showing previously-saved desktops:
   M-x desktop-autosave-show
 Deleting a previously-saved desktop:
   M-x desktop-autosave-delete-desktop RET <desktop name> RET <confirm> RET

Main e-lisp functions:
 (desktop-autosave-start (&optional desktop-name force-proceed)
 (desktop-autosave-current-session)
 (desktop-autosave-stop &optional save)
 (desktop-autosave-currently-saving)
 (desktop-autosave-show)
 (desktop-autosave-delete-desktop (&optional name)

Installation:
You probably want to include this functionality in your ~/.emacs as follows:
 (setq load-path (cons "<path to this file>" load-path))
 (require 'desktop-autosave)

You may also want to customize in your ~/.emacs what global
settings get saved with the desktop. See
http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/power-user-tips.html for
suggestions.

Configuration:
  EMACS_DESKTOP_REPOSITORY Environment variable that, if present and
  not empty, determines the directory where the desktops are saved. If
  not present, defaults to $HOME/.emacs.d/desktop-sessions

The code below is based loosely on Joseph Brenner's "Desktop
Recover" package (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DesktopRecover).

Known issues:
* Saving on the desktop when exiting emacs leads to an infinite loop
  and is currently disabled. This should not affect the effectiveness
  of this package, since there are plenty of other places where the
  desktop is saved.

Enhancements under consideration:
* Saving frame configurations along with the desktop
